        <h2>Cloud Benefits</h2>
        <p>The benefits of using cloud hosting include flexiability, pay-as-you-go models and reliabity. Traditional hosting services offer limited bandwidth;
           cloud hosting scales to accommodate traffic spikes or seasonal demands. Users only pay for the resources they use by the month or hours. Tradditional hostin uses flat rates.
           Hardware failures do not cause downtime because sites and applications are hosted on a network of servers. 
           Traffic travels across separate network interfaces, where it is segregated and secured.
